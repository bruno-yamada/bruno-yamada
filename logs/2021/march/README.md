- sometimes, to get things done you will need to poke people beyond what would be polite, unfortunately, somethings get done quicker you stay on top of people responsible, if ticket priority and SLAs were properly respected and defined it probably wouldn't be the case
- when there is a long/complex process that will need to be repeatable(and not automatable), it can be helpful to create a jira task with the steps as subtasks, and create it as a template that can be copied to other use cases
