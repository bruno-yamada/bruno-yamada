# My Rules

## Don't assume anything

Be careful when assuming something, always get clear definitions, objectives,
plans of actions and so on.

Our assumptions and deductions might take us very far, I know it did it for me,
but when I got my first international job, and had to speak english all day,
while dealing with many different cultures from around the globe, I noticed that
what sometimes I could easily assume in my previous jobs was no longer the case.
Maybe it was due to language barriers, maybe it was my lack of understanding of
enlgish nuances, and could also have been the differences between my nationality
and theirs regarding way of work, nevertheless I learned to try and get to clear
definitions of what needs to be done, what is being agreed upon, what is the
goal for a task, I never hurts to be specific and it is definitely better than
wasting time due to some misunderstanding.

## Respect legacy code

When dealing with legacy projects and code, take a step back before judging.
