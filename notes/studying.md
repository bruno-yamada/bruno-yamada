# About studying

> One of the most important steps to learning, is understanding how much you know and how well you know it
> "if it didnt change your behaviour, you didnt learned it" - meaning, it needs to spark action and result
> Sometimes it is better to "just do it" and get into action, but is famous for leaving gaps in your knowledge, you also need the more advanced theorical knowledge from books and documentation

break study into little pieces
- Most of the learning is done in the first 25 to 30 minutes (that is the usual pomodoro timer)
- you need a "treat" for after you studied, some sort of reward
- study for only small amounts, so it is effective, give your self a reward, that it is not pushing and are tempted to avoid studying
you need a study area
- environments you study on have a primary function, bedroom for sleeping, living room for socializing, for study, you need a properly purposed environment
- when you study in your room, you might be tempted to sleeping, that is what your body is conditioned to do in your room, when you are in a living room, you are tempted by the tv, and other forms of entertaiment, that is what you usually do there, also your roomates/colleagues/spouse might interrupt you, and it is not their fault, living room is for socializing
- a research with students: they live in dorm rooms, they eat/socialize/groom/sleep in the same space they study, how to condition yourself? they were given a "study lamp" to turn on whenever they where studying, that way you were conditioned, you turn the lamp on, it is study time, and by itself, it increased their hability to focus and learn

Concepts vs Facts
- are you learning concepts or facts?
  - facts eg.: how many bits in a byte
  - concept eg.: agile development
- concepts are more important, they stay longer than cold facts
- adults tend to remember more concepts than facts(facts you look it up)
- you need to put the concept in your own words
  - because then, you got the meaning, it clicked, you know the concept

Don't mistake recognition for recollection
- you can highlight a topic or important phrase in a book, later when you revisit the book you see the highlighted part and might think you remember it, when in fact you are just recognizing it
- to recollect is to know the topic without the book highlights, to go back to the chapter, after a time, and by memory alone know what it was about

Take notes
- be careful not to take "empty notes" you need to rationalize about them
- put your notes in your own words, notes are the important topics and concepts
- and most importantly, maybe a __golden rule__, soon after a class, sit down with your notes and explore them, add more content, more deepen content, if you wait too long, the memory might fade

Teaching is one of the best ways to learn
- write and take notes as if you are going to teach it to someone
- cant write? read, look up, try to explain to yourself or out loud with your own words
- an piece research stated, 80% of your study time is better spend reciting, and only 20% reading

One of the methods explored by Pedagogy is the SQ4R (used to be SQ3R, Relate is new)
- Survey
  - look at the overall picture, the concepts, what the topic is about, before getting into the details, that way you know what to look for when learning
- Question
  - As you survey, you raise questions about the contents, what is this part of the chapter, what is it about
- Read
  - as you read, you answer questions, and new ones might show up, forming a big picture
- Recite
  - now answer the questions in your own words, as if you were teaching, if you cant, maybe you asked the wrong questions, or you might need to read again
- Relate
  - Bring the concepts to something you already know, if it holds personal meaning, it is easier to remember
- Review
  - reviewing will minimize your memory decay, after reading, take some time, recollect the questions, concepts, answers
  - one of the problems with scheduled tests in schools, is that people only start studying when close to the deadlines, if you study preemptively, by the time the tests, comes, it is mostly reviewing

Learning Facts
- To memorize facts, use mnemonics (any system that facilitates recall, e.g. acronyms, coined sayings, interactive images)
