# Knowledge Levels (WIP)
> methodology by [rwxrob Badges](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/20210924134227/README.md)

As I stated in my [studying notes](./notes/studying.md), one of the most important things about learning is that you need assess what you know and how much of it you know, also if you learn and don't act on it, you might not have learned at all.

That is why I have compiled here what I know, and how deeply I know it, so that I can compare my knowledge levels, findout where I want to get to, and where to focus on.

Also, usually, in our field, when we start listing what we know, it can quickly turn into a soup of acronyms and weird names, so to have this information here also makes it easier for me to rationalize about what I do know, as in our field, we often learn about a lot of things non-stop.

There are several levels of depth to any specific Boost Badge:

1. Basics (conversant, has sampled and mastered something minimal)
1. Essentials (working knowledge, just enough to explore and be dangerous)
1. Proficiency (full professional proficiency, could be paid for)
1. Excellence (beyond proficiency, innovative application of)
1. Mastery (domain leader, able to instruct and expound about)

Each level has an implied title that depends on the specific badge. Let's look at something like bash:

1. Bash User (can use the command line, history, tab completion)
1. Bash Coder (write simple scripts and own bashrc config)
1. Bash Programmer (can do anything in man page for an employer)
1. Bash Developer (designs complex applications and integrations)
1. Bash Master (could write book involving multiple projects)

This means, skill levels range from 0 to 5 (zero is no knowledge at all)
