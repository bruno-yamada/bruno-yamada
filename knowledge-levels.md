# Knowledge Levels (WIP)
> inspired by https://github.com/rwxrob

As I stated in my [studying notes](./notes/studying.md), one of the most important things about learning is that you need assess what you know and how much of it you know, also if you learn and don't act on it, you might not have learned at all.

That is why I have compiled here what I know, and how deeply I know it, so that I can compare my knowledge levels, findout where I want to get to, and where to focus on.

Also, usually, in our field, when we start listing what we know, it can quickly turn into a soup of acronyms and weird names, so to have this information here also makes it easier for me to rationalize about what I do know, as in our field, we often learn about a lot of things non-stop.
