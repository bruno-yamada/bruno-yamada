I am an SRE/DevOps/Programmer from Brazil working remotely for overseas companies, this is my `knowledge backup` so to speak.

For ages I have been doing a lot notes on markdown files and scripts and, most of the time, keeping them on private repositories or just on my laptop, but recently I realized most of then didn't contain any private information and often I shared my notes with colleagues, so I'm now building this repo to keep it openly available by default.

I write a lot of things, and take many notes, the process helps me summarize and rationalize about what I'm trying to learn, besides, having it in plain text often helps me since I can easily search through and find some old link, resource, idea or script that I have wrote in the past.

## Disclaimer:
This work has been started on february 2021, so don't shy away because of its current size, it is going to be continually incremented and developed for sure.
